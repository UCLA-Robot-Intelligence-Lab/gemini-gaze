"""
This file contains the implementation of Gaze History

Essentially, we don't want the model to run at every single arbitrary gaze coordinate.
The implementation of this file may change soon, but essentially, my heuristic solution is to wait until the user has been looking at a specific item for x amount of time
only after the user has been staring at the same point (or around the same area buffer) the model analyzes the intention and executes task

In this scenario, a "timestep" refers to the time it takes for a single frame to be rendered/loaded
